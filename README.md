# Nozes
It's just a simpler way to create elements instead of use document.createElement()

## How to use
```javascript
div(
  h1('Hello, world'),
  a({ href='#' }, 'Click here')
)
```

## It's just that?
Yes. But you can do awesome things, like create plain javascript reactive components.

## Why 'Nozes'?
It's a joke, an old brazilian meme called "As Ã¡rvores somos nozes", that could be translated as "The tree are us". Nozes it's about DOM tree.
