# Nozes
## Element components with plain javascript
It's just a collection of simpler way to create elements instead of use dococument.createElement

## How to use
'''javascript
  div(
    h1('Hello, world'),
    a({ href='#' }, 'Click here')
  )
'''

## It's just that?
Yes. But you can do awesome things, like create plain javascript reactive components.

## Why 'Nozes'?
It's a joke. An old brazilian meme called "As Ã¡rvores somos nozes", that could be translated as "The tree are us". Nozes it's about DOM tree.
